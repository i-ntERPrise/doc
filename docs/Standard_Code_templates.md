## Standard Code Templates

All provided code in the database and JSON payload layer uses standard
code templates, which will also be published at the time when the
product will ship as GA.

Additionally we are committed to work with participating developers, in
providing standardized code templates for all general functions and will
publish these as part of the base product, as soon as formally approved
by the committee.
