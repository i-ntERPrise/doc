## Compiler Directives

Due to the potential complexity and nuances possible by using compiler
directives, this project will NOT use ANY custom compiler directives.
All participating developers should consciously consider the bulk of the
adopting developers. Details about the potential consumers can be found
at [Target Audience](Target_Audience.md)
