## Supported programming languages

This entire initiative is dedicated to all the languages that forms part
of the ILE programming model on IBM i: RPG, COBOL, C, C++ and CL for the
back-end code. Standard JSON payloads will be rendered for ANY front-end
“consumption”.

HTML5 and CSS3 combined with JavaScript or ANY language or environment
that can “consume” or integrate with JSON, will be the preferred
mechanism for delivering interfaces and integration to other
systems/users/API’s.
