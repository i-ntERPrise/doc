## Use and leveraging of standard IBM i objects and architecture

It is of utmost importance that the inherent capabilities of IBM i and DB2 for i be exploited as far as possible, as this is where the platform and architecture shines. Of specific relevance is the tight integration between the operating system, DB2 and ILE, whilst establishing and implementing “separation” between the database and the HLL used.

The leveraging standard IBM i workmanagement, \*USRSPC, \*USRIDX, \*MSGF, pointer based integration, etc. are of critical importance.
