## RLA and SQL result set processing

The intERPrise architecture and database services constructs supports
and leverages both RLA and SQL result set processing, in order to
deliver maximum performance. This leaves developers of ANY consumptive
service (be it any UI, a micro service, an API or any similar mechanism
to facilitate human or system integration) to provide best performing
solutions.

Kindly review the provided code, to understand how this is implemented.
