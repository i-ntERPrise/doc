## Enhancing procedures/functions

All provided procedures/functions will implement the same approach IBM
has followed on IBM i API’s, where additional or enhanced functionality
(where parameter changes are required) will be implemented with new
optional parameter sets at the end of the parameter list, to prevent
“breaking” existing functions.

Kindly see “IBM i: Programming API overview and concepts” for more
details.
