## Supported Operating System Releases

The intERPrise solution is intended for IBM i release 7.2 (available
since May 2, 2014) and IBM i release 7.3 (available since April 15,
2016). It is possible to install and compile for earlier releases of the
operating system with quite a bit of manual intervention and potentially
changing some code, although we STRONGLY advise against it.

Companies should rather use this opportunity to get current on the
operating system release and to adopt modern software engineering
development practices.
