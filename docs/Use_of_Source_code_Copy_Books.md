## Use of Source code “Copy Books”

Copy books are used extensively, limited to a single function/procedure
per copybook, to achieve source code re-use, similar to how
functions/procedures within modules are used in \*SRVPGM’s from an
object perspective. It facilitates “single instance” definition of code
snippets and also enables a clean interface and integration between
components.
