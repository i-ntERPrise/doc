## Suggested maximum number of elements/components

The primary consideration at all times should be maintainability of the
produced code. We enforce a HARD limit of maximum 36 modules (enforced
by the naming convention) per \*SRVPGM and suggest that the number of
procedures/functions per module should be limited to approximately 50 or
as close to that as is practical, to facilitate manageability.
