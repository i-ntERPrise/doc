## Use of FULLY FREE format RPG source

As indicated earlier highlighting the conundrum around availability of tooling to maintain the provided source, the committee was forced to adopt a policy of implementing partially free code, against our wishes.

This decision was taken in the best interest of primarily the SMB developer community (the most likely potential adopters), who has little choice in the tooling at their disposal. They are forced to use what their employer provides.

As a result, we will adopt “free” RPG code, as far as ADTS and RDi releases prior to RDi 9.5 syntax checker will recognize (kindly see [Recommended IDE Release](Recommended_IDE_Release.md) for more detail). The various AO provided database components will clearly delineate and demonstrate what the committee currently considers as best practices.
