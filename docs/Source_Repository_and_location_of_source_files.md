## Source Repository and location of source files

We acknowledge that this decision will likely be a contentious one, as
it seems to be a very emotive debate. Underpinning this decision, is the
issue of the resulting object names, with specific reference to the
QSYS.LIB file system and the IFS, and where the bulk of SMB developers
find themselves. This consideration goes hand in hand with the
consideration of who will likely adopt and use the solution.

As a result, being heavily influenced by the object names and the
potential users, all published source code will be structured to
leverage the QSYS.LIB file system, which most developers are intimately
familiar with. It is only the young generation that will need guidance
in understanding this structure. It is however so simple and logical,
that it should take a short while for young developers to understand the
significance and beautiful simplicity of source code in the QSYS.LIB
file system, where the true power of IBM i are demonstrated.

Kindly study the section [Source Files](Source_Files.md) for a detailed list of published source files.
