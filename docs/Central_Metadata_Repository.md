## Central Metadata Repository (aka “Data Dictionary”)

Fundamental to the data centric development paradigm, is a central
metadata repository that contains all information describing and
pertaining to any data element in the entire system; a single source of
the truth.

Any attribute of any data element, including all validation rules
pertaining to that element, as well as detailed record where the element
is used, is dynamically maintained and used by AO. This is the most
critical base element of any system and is fundamental to a cohesive
data quality and data integrity strategy, which is of paramount
importance in today’s world of cognitive processing.

Any decision is only as good as the quality and relevance of the
business rule underpinning that element. The entire premise underpinning
data centricity and a central metadata repository is to manage and
control **DATA QUALITY** and **INTEGRITY** (including no orphan
records).
