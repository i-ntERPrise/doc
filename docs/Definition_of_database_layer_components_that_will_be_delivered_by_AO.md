## Definition of database layer components that will be delivered by AO

AO will provide and maintain the entire database layer, which includes a metadata repository {aka data dictionary}, validation rules repository, tables {aka physical files}, logical layer {aka logical files, indexes, views}, constraints, triggers, IO Services and Enterprise Services – a genuine “data-centric”, modern DB2 implementation that is “self-aware” and “self-enforcing”.

Kindly review the published architecture at <https://www.i-nterprise.org/about.html>

No naming of ANY database component will be left to the operating system. ALL components will be named and managed by the Committee, using AO.
