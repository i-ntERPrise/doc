## Standardized Error Handling

All software error handling must use the provided message files and
standardized error handling services. No deviation from this can be
accepted, as the database and operating system are the originating
source for any software errors or failures.

If the provided error handling services do not cater for a specific
condition, kindly contact management@i-nterprise.org with descriptive
details of the limitation. A master enhancement will be provided, if it
is indeed a limitation.
