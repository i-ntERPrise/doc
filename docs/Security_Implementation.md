## Security Implementation

Due to the inherent security capabilities of IBM i and DB2 for i,
intERPrise implements and leverages the native capabilities, to deliver
an implementation we believe exemplifies how data can be secured. This
is implemented at the lowest possible level within the operating system
in each instance and consistent with the data centric approach.

This ensures for instance that even QSECOFR cannot inject ANY database
records into the database, except through the published interfaces.
